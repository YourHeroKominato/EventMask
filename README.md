## Background
Web3 community has been organizing more and more offline events lately!
Especially for operating Dao, offline events have become an important part of community.

But running an event requires

- the operator to manage the status of participants and
- get participants addresses registered and send them NFTs

## Summary
The product we have created, EventMask, is a great way to get people to register their addresses and send out NFTs.

EventMask aims to help Dao and other web3 communities to manage and organize offline events.
